## RHP-UI-EXAMPLE-COMPONENTS

A simple list of components written in plain HTML and SCSS to assist with UI development for RHP web and mobile Apps. This is just a guide. Pick and choose the code you need and convert to React in production.

CSS/SCSS implements the BEM naming convention.


##### Getting started

```sh
$ npm install
```
