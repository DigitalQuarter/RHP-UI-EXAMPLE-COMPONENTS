## RHP-UI-EXAMPLE-COMPONENTS

A simple list of components written in plain HTML and SCSS to assist with UI development for RHP web and mobile Apps. This is just a guide. Pick and choose the code you need and convert to React in production.

CSS/SCSS implements the BEM naming convention.

CSS animations and transitions are included within components.

Some components included example JS functions that add and remove animation classes on button clicks, etc,. These are just examples of how we want them to work. Code is not intended for production use in react.
